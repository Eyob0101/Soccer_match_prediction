### Motivation 
Soccer is the most popular and unpredictable sports in the 
the world because of its uncertainty many people have lost so much 
money on Soccer betting. According to [this](https://www.quora.com/Is-football-an-unpredictable-game-If-so-why) post
there are many resons that can make it hard to guess what would happen in any match but on the other side soccer is also rich 
with data and stats which makes it perfect problem for machine learning. I am a big Soccer fan and also a bettor I have lost so much money by placing the wrong bets.
every time I lost a bet I always wished to have some sort of app that tells me the winner of the match before I placed a bet 
That is what motivates me to build this app.

since it have a user interface its basically for everybody who are intersted
